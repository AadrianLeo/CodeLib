## Documentaion for users to edit and use it at local server.

To run the server in local server.

create an .env file in server folder and enter :

> ```OPENAI_API_KEY = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"```

You can get the api key from openai officail wesite : [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

After implementing the changes in server folder go to terminal > go to the server folder in the project > Type Command :

```
  npm install or npm i
  npm run server
```
your server is running and will be available on localhost:5000

To run the Frontend / Client side :

Do some changes first :

Go to file : `client > script.js`

change the server link to the local host link

```
// fetch data from server -> bot's response

  const response = await fetch('http://localhost:5000', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      prompt: data.get('prompt')
    })
  })
 ```
 
 Then open terminal > Go into the client folder in the project > Type the command :
 ```
  npm install or npm i
  npm run dev 
```

Now the client site is running no local server too

it may be runnig no this local host http://127.0.0.1:5173/ or can be another
